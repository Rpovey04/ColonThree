# ColonThree
A GAN that can generate cat images

### Dataset
Dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset
Since the project aims to generate images (and not classify on a deeper level or perform any kind of tracking / annotation) the labels for each image (files ending in .cat) have been deleted. Only those ending in .jpg have been used
Images from the files CAT_00 to CAT_05 have been used for training while CAT_06 is reserved as the testing set
